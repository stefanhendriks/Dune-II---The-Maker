  the most recent versions (from the `config' CVS repository).

. builds/freetype.mk (refdoc): Update the `--title' option.

********* The items below should be done but are out-of-date due *********
********* to the move of the FreeType CVS and web pages.         *********


. Call `make refdoc' to update HTML reference.  Copy it to
  freetype2/docs/reference in the `www' CVS module and update the CVS.
  Then call `update-www' in ~/cvs/scripts on www.freetype.org to
  update and distribute everything to sourceforge.

. Tag the CVS (freetype, ft2demos, www/freetype2/docs).

. Update `make-release' and `make-current' in ~/cvs/scripts/ on
  www.freetype.org, then call them.

. Create an md5 checksum file (with md5sum).

. Announce new release on announce@freetype.org and to relevant newsgroups.

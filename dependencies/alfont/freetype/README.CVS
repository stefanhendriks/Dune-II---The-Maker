The CVS archive doesn't contain pre-built configuration scripts for
UNIXish platforms.  To generate them say

  sh autogen.sh

which in turn depends on the following packages:

  automake (1.9.4)
  libtool (1.5.16)
  autoconf (2.59b)

The versions given in parentheses are known to work.  Note that autogen.sh
also sets up proper file permissions for the configure and auxiliary
scripts.

For static builds which don't use platform specific optimizations no
configure script is necessary at all; saying

  make setup ansi
  make

should work on all platforms which have GNU make (or makepp).

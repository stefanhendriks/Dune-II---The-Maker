## Compiling
This project uses `CMake`, you need atleast version 3.21. It currently depends
on MinGW32. Make sure you can run `make` (or `ninja`) from command line.

Then:
- git clone this project
- create a `build` dir
```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
    cmake --build . --target all -- -j 6
```

If you use `ninja` you can use `cmake .. -G Ninja` instead.

Once compilation is done you'll end up with a `d2tm.exe` file and several DLL's.

## Running
Easiest is to run the executable from the root. Shared libraries that are required are: alfont.dll, alleg42.dll, almp3.dll, libwinpthread-1.dll and mscvr70.dll.
The required libraries (Allegro 4, ALFont, ALMP3) are in the [dll folder](https://github.com/stefanhendriks/Dune-II---The-Maker/tree/master/dll/mingw).
libwinpthread-1.dll Could be on your MinGW path. If it is not on the path, copy it from your mingw32 installation.

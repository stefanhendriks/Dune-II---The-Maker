Dune II - The Maker
===================
A.k.a. D2TM. Is a [Dune 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II) clone. At this moment the most known/stable version is [DEMO4 and DEMO 3.5](http://dune2themaker.fundynamic.com/?page_id=11) which are very old and using
Allegro & other libs. I am proud of that project, but it is time to rewrite it and build a game mostly focussing on skirmish
and networking gaming.

This is an attempt to rewrite the game from scratch using [SDL 1.2](http://www.libsdl.org/). If you are looking for the source code of the 'current' D2TM ([with demo binaries](http://dune2themaker.fundynamic.com/downloads/)), then you can find it [here](https://github.com/stefanhendriks/Dune-II---The-Maker/tree/d2tm_allegro)

I do this purely for fun, and try to keep it multi-platform. I test it often on Mac OSX and Ubuntu. I sometimes test it
on Windows (MinGW32 and MSYS).


Current State
-------------
If you want to know what is possible with the current version, see the [DONE features list](#done).
If you want to know what still has to be done, (you might want to contribute?), see the [TODO list](#todo) below what needs to be done.

There is no binary available, instead you need to [compile it yourself](#compiling).

Contributing
------------
Check the [TODO list](#todo). Create (or checkout) a feature branch. Code. And once you're finished
submit it as a pull request.

Compiling
=========
This project has makefiles for Windows (mingw32), Linux (ubuntu) and Mac OSX.

Dependencies:
- SDL 1.2
- SDL Image
- SDL Gfx

After you check out this project, copy the appropiate makefile (with the extension matching your OS) as 'makefile'. After that hit make.

Example, OSX && [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/):
------------------------------------------------------------
- Install XCode CLI tools
- Using brew, install dependencies: `brew install SDL sdl_image sdl_gfx`
- Then: `cp makefile.osx makefile`
- `make`

Example, Ubuntu (inspired by [Lazy Foo](http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/linux/))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fetch g++ and its dependencies with apt-get:

        apt-get install g++
- Fetch SDL and its dependencies with apt-get:

        apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
- `cp makefile.ubuntu makefile`
- `make`

As a player I should be able to...
==================================
Features need to be written in such a way that it is obvious what the benefit is for the player.

TODO
----
- have foot-men (soldiers, infantry, trooper, troopers, fremen, all are alike)
<del>
  <ul>
    <li>draw soldier (as a single celled unit)</li>
    <li>draw five soldiers on cell</li>
    <li>can move on mountains</li>
    <li>make it possible to select a single soldier on a cell occupied by multiple soldiers</li>
    <li>normal units should still be able to move to other cells</li>
  </ul>
</del>
  - unit taking sub-cell (soldier) should be able to move to destination, and remain on sub-cell
  - when sub-cell is taken, then unit will take other sub-cell if available
  - when all sub-cells are taken, the cell is occupied
  - when not all sub-cells are taken, the cell is not occupied
  - should be blocked by ground/wheeled units
  - units from a different house may not occupy the same cell
  - can be squished by heavy units
  - animate moving of unit
- modify the properties of units/structures by modifying a rules.ini file
- move vehicles around larger obstacles (like bases, mountains, etc) (path-finding on 'really-need-it-basis')
- move (my) units appropriately
  - sandworms should only be able to travel through sand, dunes and spice, and be blocked by rock/mountains
  - heavy vehicles should be able to move over infantry (fatal for the infantry).
  - air units should not be blocked by anything
- defend myself with walls
  - draw walls
  - walls should obstruct terrain units of all kinds
  - walls smoothing
  - terrain smoothing adjustments with walls
- see structures (draw them)
- have my ground wheeled/tank vehicles be blocked by structures
- select my structure
- use my infantry to take over enemy structures
  - the more damaged the structure is, the more chance of taking over
  - (fatal for the infantry, but chance of capture)
- have enemies to defeat
  - enemy units should not be visible when shrouded
  - enemy units should not be selectable
  - only show health bar when mouse hovers over enemy unit
- see everything move in a certain pace (timed) at all time , regardless of my fps ([this post is helpful](http://gameprogrammingtutorials.blogspot.nl/2010/01/sdl-tutorial-series-part-5-dealing-with.html))
- destroy units so i can win the game destroying my enemy's units
- destroy structures so i can win the game destroying my enemy's structures
- order a unit to attack another unit in order to destroy it
- order a unit to attack a structure in order to destroy it
- order a unit to attack a tile so I can destroy a wall or something else (ie, a sandworm perhaps)
- sandworms should only be able to travel through sand, dunes and spice, and be blocked by rock/mountains
- fear the sandworm
  - sandworm eats units on sand/dunes/spice
  - sandworm can get 'full' and dissapear (? or wander around messing with your mind?)
- send my vehicles to a repair bay in order to get the patched up and use them fully again.
- send my harvester back to the refinery in order to get the credits earlier
- build another structure from a Construction Yard
- place built structures
- build infantry from a Barracks
- build troopers from a WOR
- build light vehicles from a Light Factory
- build heavy vehicles from a Heavy Factory
 - build tanks
  - tanks should be able to face their body to the adjecent cell and face their barrel to the target (as should turrets)
- build air units from a High-Tech
- upgrade my structures to gain access to other units
- upgrade my units (??)
- receive reinforcements from time to time
- mine spice with a harvester
- deploy an MCV
- get my units transported much faster by a carry-all
- scroll by holding mouse key and move from that position
- when a unit is bored, it should turn around randomly
- when a unit is on guard, it should target enemies within range, as should turrets
- play on a randomized map
- harvesters should harvest without being instructed
 - when a harvester is first deployed, it head for the nearest spice field that the player can see
 - when a harvester is deployed, it keeps using the same spice field unless instructed otherwise
 - when a harvester discovers a spice field is empty, it will head for the nearest field. 
   - ... but if the harvester has spice, it will return first. (?)
 - the user can find out how much spice a harvester contains
 - when nonempty, a harvester when destroyed spills its spice
 - when full, the harvester will return to the nearest refinery, using a carryall if available
 - if the refinery is busy, the harvester will move to another one if it is nearby, otherwise it will wait (?)
 - harvesters will harvest parts of the field with a higher value, because there are no graphics for thick spice/sand boundary.
 - harvesters entering a refinery will deposit credits
 - spice will be distributed across a player's refineries and silos
 - spice will be lost if there is insufficient storage
- User can select all units of the same type on the screen
- User can select all units of the same type on the battlefield
- Play using only:
 - The keyboard, or
 - The mouse
  - specifically, single-clicking the LMB (touch)

Thus far the following controls work:

Press `q` to quit anytime.
Move camera around with arrow keys or with mouse hitting borders of screen.

Right mouse click deselects all unit.
Left mouse click selects a unit.
Hold left mouse button and drag a rectangle over units to select them.

    Do note this, is basically just an "update" call, but takes amount of update cycles into account, so we make sure
    we do not skip or get sloppy with update loops. Although, the entire 'update' in this game is a bit hairy, you would
    expect this function to be called by the main update function. Heck, even per state this would be different - which
